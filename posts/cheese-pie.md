It's the king of pies. A pie, but with only cheese in it. Just cheese. None of that other stuff. 

I recommend always eating **Cheese Pie** (with or without relish) whenever possible, because it is the best pie in the whole world.

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts about cheese
- E-commerce (cheese) product listings
- Help and documentation pages

You should ask yourself: "Can I eat this pie **whole** or do I need to make smaller slices?" If the answer is no, then you should use a large knife or maybe a cleaver.

On the other hand, swallowing a whole pie in one go is **not** a good idea if you cannot walk afterwards. Maybe your knees will go weak with showing frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use a **solid block of mature cheddar**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered cheese will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-cheesing and use client-side JavaCheese to populate your fridge.
